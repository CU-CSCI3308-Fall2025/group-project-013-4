* Walked through home page, leaderboard , and add post wireframes  
* Talked about user authentication and permissions matrix  
* Blockages: struggle with modal for add post button causing navbar to be centered (styling issue) \- this was resolved  
* This weekâ€™s goal: get user authentication working  
* Pricing/barcode API? \- maybe just focus on major stores? \- in addition to manual expense tracking.  
  * What if we did a google maps API instead that tracks where you make your transaction?
